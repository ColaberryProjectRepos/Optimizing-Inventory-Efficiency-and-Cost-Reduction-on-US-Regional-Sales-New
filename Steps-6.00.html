Currently, the order quantity is 11,308, and we procure every 3 months. However, by ordering more upfront, we end up storing inventory for 5+ months since orders for many products are spaced 5-6 months apart. To address this, reducing the order quantity by 10% to 10,177 could save $136K annually by lowering inventory holding costs, based on a standard 25% holding cost rate. With the original inventory cost at $5.4M, reducing it to $4.9M would yield an 11% ROI, demonstrating the efficiency of optimizing inventory management.<br></p>
