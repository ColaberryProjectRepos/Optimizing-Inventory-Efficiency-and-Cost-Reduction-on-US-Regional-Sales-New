3
<p><b>Data Sources: </b><br> <br>The dataset includes information on sales, inventory costs, order quantities, and warehouse performance, providing valuable insights into inventory efficiency and sales distribution across various regions. The data for this project was sourced from data.world, a platform known for its robust collection of publicly available datasets. Specifically, the dataset comes from a US regional sales analysis and was compiled by combining three separate sheets into a single dataset for comprehensive analysis. data.world is widely used for collaboration and exploration of diverse data, making it an ideal source for this supply chain analysis project. <br><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1578/3/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></p><p><br></p><p><br><b>System Architecture: </b><br> <br>1. Understanding Business Problem &amp; Objectives: <br>The first step was defining the key challenge: optimizing inventory levels to minimize costs and increase profitability. The project's main objective is to apply machine learning models to provide actionable insights for improving procurement strategies and inventory turnover across the companyâ€™s warehouse network, with a focus on WARE-NMK1003 and WARE-NBV1002. <br>2.Data Gathering: <br>Relevant sales, inventory costs, and warehouse performance data were sourced from data.world, a trusted platform known for its comprehensive datasets. The data was extracted from a US regional sales analysis, combining three different sheets into a single dataset for detailed analysis and insight generation. <br>3. Data Preparation: <br>The dataset was cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency and readiness for machine learning. This included removing null values, standardizing columns such as dates and warehouse codes, and transforming order quantities and costs for accurate model predictions. Tools like Python and pandas were used for effective data preparation. <br>4.Model Selection / Building with Python: <br>Using Microsoft Fabric and Python, I developed classification models, specifically the Random Forest Classifier, to predict optimal order quantities and warehouse allocations. The model was trained on historical data and fine-tuned to maximize accuracy and minimize costs related to inventory management. <br>5.Gaining Insights from Model Results: <br>The model results were evaluated by analyzing key performance metrics, such as GPM%, Inventory Turnover Ratio, Lead Time, Stockout Ratio and other metrics, Total order frequency, and warehouse efficiency. Insights gained from the model help drive strategic decisions, such as reducing excess inventory and boosting sales in underperforming regions, enabling the company to achieve its cost optimization and profitability goals. <br>6. Data Visualization with Power BI: <br>Visualize the insights and predictions using Power BI, creating dynamic dashboards to display key metrics, trends, and KPIs. These visualizations help stakeholders quickly understand the findings and make informed decisions based on real-time data. <br><br> <img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1578/3/4.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br> <br><b>Data Features:</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b> </b><br>Optimizing Inventory Efficiency and Cost Reduction on US Regional sales Dashboard leverages Key data features include Procured Date, Order Date, Warehouse Code, Unit Cost, Unit Price, and Order Quantity. Warehouse Code and Order Quantity serve as the dependent variables for classification models. The data dictionary highlighted critical KPIs like Cost per order, Inventory Turnover Ratio, Lead Time, GPM%, stockout rate. The project transforms this complex data into actionable insights, helping to enhance profit margins, improve sales and inventory turnover through targeted marketing investments, and reduce overall holding costs by refining inventory management strategies across key regions. and support data-driven decision-making.</p><p> <br><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1578/3/5.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>
