<p><b>Data Preparation: </b><br> <br>The dataset was cleaned, merged, and transformed to ensure consistency across all variables. Columns related to dates, pricing, and warehouse codes were standardized for accurate analysis.  Additionally, categorical variables were encoded by using feature engineering techniques to facilitate seamless model ingestion and analysis, ensuring robust and accurate results.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1578/4/2.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></p><p><br></p><p><b>Model Selection:</b></p><p> <br>The project initially considered time-series analysis but transitioned to a classification model using RandomForestClassifier, achieving 99.6% accuracy in predicting optimal inventory levels. This model was optimal for classifying inventory management outcomes. The RandomForestClassifier was trained on historical order data to predict the optimal order quantity for each warehouse. It achieved an accuracy of 99.6%, with an F1 score, precision, and recall also at 99.6%. The model performed well across all inventory categories, ensuring precise cost optimizations.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1578/4/4.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p><p><b>Model Development:</b></p><p> <br>During model development, the RandomForestClassifier was trained and validated using cross-validation techniques to ensure its robustness across different data splits. The modelâ€™s performance was further evaluated using a confusion matrix, revealing outstanding predictive accuracy with minimal misclassifications across all inventory classes. High true positive counts and low error rates demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately classifying optimal inventory levels, reinforcing its suitability for cost optimization and inventory management tasks.</p><p></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1578/4/5.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p><p><br></p>
