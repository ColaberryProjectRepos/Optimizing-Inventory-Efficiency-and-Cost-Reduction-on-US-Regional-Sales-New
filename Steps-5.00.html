<p><b>Model Performance:</b></p><p><b> </b><br>The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated exceptional performance, with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for each class achieving a perfect area under the curve (AUC) of 1.00. This flawless AUC reflects the model's ability to maintain a high true positive rate while minimizing false positives, indicating precise and reliable classification across all inventory categories. These results highlight the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between optimal and non-optimal inventory levels, making it a powerful tool for cost optimization and inventory management within the supply chain. The modelâ€™s accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall all reached 99.6%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing inventory patterns and predicting necessary actions to optimize costs. Accuracy: 99.6%, F1 Score: 99.6%, Precision: 99.6%, Recall: 99.6% These metrics indicate that the model is highly effective in predicting inventory needs, minimizing both overstocking and stockouts.</p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1578/5/3.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p><p></p><p><br></p><p><b>Visualizations:</b></p><p> <br>This dashboard, titled "Inventory Efficiency and Cost Reduction on US Regional Sales (2017-2020)," provides a comprehensive view of key supply chain metrics to optimize inventory management. It features bar charts displaying total orders, GPM%, and stockout rates segmented by year, allowing for the identification of sales and profitability trends. The scatter plot visualizes the relationship between inventory turnover and lead time for different product categories. Each bubble represents a product category, with the size and color intensity indicating the stockout rate.  Line charts track inventory turnover ratios and lead times, offering insights into inventory efficiency and replenishment cycles. A geographical map highlights GPM% and inventory turnover across US states, pinpointing high-performing regions and areas of improvement. Key performance indicators such as cost per order, inventory turnover ratio, stockout rate, and lead time are also displayed, providing quick insights for decision-makers to drive operational improvements.<br></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1578/5/4.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>
