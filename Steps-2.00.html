2
<p>This case study explores two distinct approaches to improving inventory management and driving sales growth. Through procurement optimization in a high-performing warehouse (WARE-NMK1003) and strategic marketing efforts in an underperforming region (WARE-NBV1002), the company can achieve significant cost savings and profit increases. Both cases present strong potential returns, with inventory management improvements yielding an 11% ROI and marketing investments offering a potential 16% ROI.</p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1578/2/2.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p><p></p><p><b>Background: </b><br> <br>Inventory inefficiencies and missed sales opportunities have been identified across different regions within the company. These issues lead to inflated holding costs and reduced profitability. By optimizing procurement and implementing targeted marketing strategies, the company can address these inefficiencies and capitalize on untapped growth potential.</p><p></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1578/2/4.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></p><p><br></p><p><b>Problem Statement: </b><br> <br>Warehouses across the company exhibit inefficiencies in inventory management, leading to inflated costs and missed sales opportunities. For instance, WARE-NMK1003 generates $26 million in sales but faces excessive inventory holding, while WARE-NBV1002 experiences low sales volumes with only 3,087 orders, indicating poor inventory turnover. These issues align with broader industry trends, as studies show that approximately 43% of small businesses encounter stockouts or overstocks, resulting in lost sales or increased holding costs. To address this challenge, the project aims to optimize inventory levels to minimize costs. Initially, time-series analysis and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) algorithms were considered, but a transition to classification models has proven more effective. By leveraging these advanced models, the finance team can receive precise predictions for order quantities and warehouse allocations, driving strategic decision-making and improving overall efficiency.</p><p></p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1578/2/5.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></p><p><br></p><p><b>Objectives: </b><br> <br>The main objective of the Optimizing Inventory Efficiency and Cost Reduction project is to maximize profitability across the company's warehouse network by addressing key inefficiencies. Specifically, the project aims to optimize procurement processes at WARE-NMK1003 to enhance profit margins, improve sales and inventory turnover at WARE-NBV1002 through targeted marketing investments, and reduce overall holding costs by refining inventory management strategies across key regions. Through these efforts, the project seeks to streamline operations, improve decision-making, and ultimately drive greater financial returns.</p><p><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1578/2/6.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>
